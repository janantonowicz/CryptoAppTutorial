The purpose of this project was to improve my skills in Swift language.
This app uses SwiftUI and is written in Swift. 
This app was made by following a @SwiftfulThinking course on Youtube. 
It uses MVVM Architecture, Combine and CoreData
The project benefits form multi-threading, publishers/subscribers and data persistance.

SwiftfulThinking tutorial on youtube I have followed to create this project:
